# 🎵 Spotify Dataset Visualization with Tableau

## 🗂 Project Overview

This project explores a **Spotify dataset** using **Tableau** to visualize and analyze musical features such as **genre**, **danceability**, **tempo**, **energy**, **key**, **mode**, and **time signature**. The goal is to uncover trends in music preferences and characteristics across different genres and tracks popular in the UK.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

### 📊 1. Visualizations

Used a variety of **Tableau visualizations** to present audio feature insights in an interactive and accessible format:

- **Bar Charts** – Compared average danceability, tempo, and energy across genres.
- **Scatter Plots** – Visualized relationships between tempo, energy, and danceability.
- **Treemaps** – Displayed the distribution of songs by genre and sub-genre.
- **Bubble Charts** – Highlighted outlier tracks with extreme audio features.
- **Heat Maps** – Showed correlations between key/mode/time signature and genre.

These visuals helped to interpret abstract audio features in a visually compelling way.

### 🎛️ 2. Interactive Filtering & Dashboard Controls

- Enabled users to explore data using:
  - **Genre and feature slicers**
  - **Range filters for tempo, energy, and danceability**
  - **Interactive legends and highlight actions**
- Implemented **tooltips** with track-level details (e.g., track name, artist, feature scores).
- Allowed dynamic exploration of the musical landscape across different axes.

## 🎯 Key Insights Extracted

- 🕺 Danceability tends to be highest in Pop and EDM genres.
- ⚡ High-energy tracks dominate in Rock and Electronic genres.
- 🧠 Musical key and mode vary slightly by genre but don't strongly influence tempo or danceability.
- 🕒 Most songs in the dataset follow standard **4/4 time signatures**, regardless of genre.
